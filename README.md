# Moka POS Bar

A premium web-based POS built for bars and beverage outlets, designed for speed at the cashier desk and clarity for business owners.

## What Makes This POS Stand Out
- **Fast checkout flow** with keyboard-friendly interactions and touch-friendly controls.
- **Modern premium UI** (Dark + Gold) that looks polished on desktop, tablet, and mobile.
- **Role-based operations** so each team member sees only what they need.
- **Real business insight** with revenue, cost, and gross profit tracking in one place.
- **Production-ready architecture** on Laravel 11 + Blade + Alpine (no heavy SPA overhead).
